# 3D Animations with Three JS

This example project demonstrates how you can build render 3d animations with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) Revideo.

The animation itself in this project is not very complex - its main purpose is to demonstrate how you can use three.js together with Revideo and make use of concepts such as [tweening](https://docs.re.video/tweening/) in 3D.
